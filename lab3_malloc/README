ep_mm.c中是显示空闲链表的实现
mm.c   中是隐式空闲链表的实现

未实现：
分离的空闲链表（分离适配 or 伙伴系统）


***********
Main Files:
***********

mm.{c,h}	
	Your solution malloc package. mm.c is the file that you
	will be handing in, and is the only file you should modify.

mdriver.c	
	The malloc driver that tests your mm.c file

./trace/1,2.rep
	Two tiny tracefiles to help you get started. 

Makefile	
	Builds the driver

**********************************
Other support files for the driver
**********************************

memlib.{c,h}	Models the heap and sbrk function

*******************************
Building and running the driver
*******************************
To build the driver, type "make" to the shell.

To run the driver on a tiny test trace:

	unix> ./mdriver
